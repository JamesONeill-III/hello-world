# hello-world
My first repository!!
I am a Computer Science Student at a local community college, "Citrus Community College". I was formerly a Nurse but decided to make a change to my carrer path. Currently I am working in C++ and Python. I am new, but I am trying to learn fast. I have already completed the Visual Basic and Introductory C++ classes at my community college. I also take classes on treehouse and now am trying to make my own simple programs. Hopefully, I can learn and contribute to the github community. "HELLO WORLD!"
